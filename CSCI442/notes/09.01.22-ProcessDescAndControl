Chapter 3: Process Description and Control

OS MAnagement of Application Execution:
- resources are made available to multiple applications
- the processor is switched among multiple applications so all will appear to be progressing
- the processor and I/O devices can be used efficiently 

Process Concept
- An operating system executes a variety of programs
	- batch system - JOBS
	- time-shared systems - USER PROGRAMS or TASKS

- The terms JOB and PROCESS almost interchangeably

- PROCESS - a program in execution; process execution must progress in sequential fashion

- Program is PASDSIVE entity stored on disk (EXECUTABLE FILE), process is ACTIVE
	- Program becomes process when executable file loaded into memory

Process Concept:
- the program code , also called TEXT SECTION
- DATA SECTION containing global variables
- HEAP containing mmr dynamically allocated during run time
- STACK containing tmp data
	- function param, return addr, local var
- current activity including PC, processor registers

Heap and Stack:
THE STACK:
- tmp mmr where var are stored while a funct. is executing
- when the funct. finishes, the mmr is cleared automatically

THE HEAP: mmr that the programmer can use for the pplication in a more manual way.
- You have to allocate mmr, use it, and then free it up afterwards all by hand.

Process Elements:
- Two essential elements of the a process are

PROGRAM CODE: which may be shared w/ other processes that are executing the same program

A SET OF DATA ASSOCIATED W/ THAT CODE: when the processor begins to execute the program code, we refere to this executing entity as a PROCESS

Process Control Block:
- Contains the process elements
- It is possible to interrupt a running process and later resume execution as if the interruption had not occured
- created and managed by the operating system 
- key tool that allows support for multiple processes

Process States:
- TRACE: the behavior of an individual process by listing the sequence of instructions that execute for that process
	- the behavior of the processor can be characterized by showing how the traces of various processes are interleaved
- DISPATCHER: small program that switches the processor from one process to another
