- you read how long it is, you have limitation for file reading if you used a fixed number
ex. values = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int) *5); => 5 is fixed

Practice Questions:
1. The convention in modern OS and compilers is that the _____ of a process contains tmp data such as function params, return addresses and local vars.
- text section
- data section
- stack
Answer: stack

2. A process control block ____
- contains a process' states
- stores the executable code the process will run
- deterimes which process is to be run next
Answer: contains a process' states

Two-State Process Model:
a. single-blocked queue
vs.
b. multiple-blocked queues
Theoretically OS will scan all the blocks in the queues before it moves on...

Suspended Processes:
- What will happen if we run out of process mmr?
- Swapping 
	- invovles moving part of all of a process from main mmr to disk
	- when none of the processes in main mmr is in the ready state, the OS swaps one of the blocked processes out on to disk into a suspend queue

DISK <======== MAIN MMR

*insert Figure 3.9*
- When all of the processes in main mmr are in the Blocked state, the OS can suspend one process by putting it in the Suspend state and transferring it to disk. The space that is freed in main mmr can then be used to bring in another process

*insert new State Figure 3.9*
*** POTENTIAL EXAM QUESTION*** fill in the different states

- want to add new state:
- Blocked -> Blocked/Suspend: If there are no ready processes, then at least one blocked process is swapped out to make room for another process that is not blocked
- Blocked Suspend -> Ready/Suspend: A process in the Blocked/Suspend state is moved to the Ready/Suspend state when the event for which it has been waiting occurs
- Ready/Suspend -> Ready: When there are no ready processes in main mmr, the OS will need to bring one in to continue execution
- Ready -> Ready/Suspend: Normally the OS would prefer to suspend a blocked process rather than a ready one b/c the ready process can now be executed, whereas the blocked process is taking up main mmr space and can't be executed

Characteristics of a Suspended Process:
- The process may or may not be waiting for an event
- The process is not immediately available for execution
- The process was placed in a suspended state by an agent: either itself, a parent process, or the OS, for the purpose of preventing its execution
- The process may not be removed from this state until the agent explicity orders the removal

Reasons for Process Suspension:
- Swapping
- Other OS reason
- Interactive User Request
- Timing
- Parent process request

dashed liine: you are waiting 

What is a mmr table?
- used to keep track of both main (real) and secondary (virtual) mmr
- process are maintained on secondary mmr using some sort of virtual mmr or simple swapping mechanism
Must Include:
- allocation of main mmr to processes
- allocation of secondary mmr to processes 
- protection attributes of blocks of main or virtual mmr
- info needed to manage virtual mmr

I/O tables
- Used by OS to manage I/O devices and channels of the computer system 
- At any given time, an I/O device may be available or assign to a particular process
- If an I/O operation is in progress, the OS needs to know: 
	- the status of the I/O operation
	- the location in main mmr being used as the source or destination of I/O transfer
